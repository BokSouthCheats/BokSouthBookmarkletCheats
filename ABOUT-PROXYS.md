# Proxy Servers

### Using one of the links inside of the Proxy Servers folder, you will be redirected to a website that you can use to use hacks inside of your favorite games, like Blooket and Prodigy.

## But how?

### You can use the hacks javascript code inside of the built in console.

## How do i use it?

### To use Interstellar, you can use the home screen to go to your favorite game's website, like prodigygame.com or blooket.com. (it might be slow, but that is fine.) Next, you can use the Inspect button in the top-right to input your javascript code.

## How do i get that code?

### Go to the directory of your desired hack inside of the Bookmarks. Next, right click on it and select Edit. Copy the URL from that bookmark and paste it into the console of Interstellar.
